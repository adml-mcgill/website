							<p>Intralattice is a plugin for Grasshopper used to generate solid lattice structures within a 3D design space. It was developed as an extensible, open-source alternative to current commercial solutions. As an ongoing project developed at McGillâ€™s Additive Design & Manufacturing Laboratory (ADML), it has been a valuable research tool, serving as a platform for breakthroughs in multi-scale design and optimization. By giving you full access to the source, we hope to collectively explore lattice design at a deeper level, and consequently, engineer better products.</p>

							<p>The rise of additive manufacturing (i.e. 3D printing) has allowed engineers to integrate new orders of complexity into their designs. In that regard, this software generates lattice structures as a means to:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Reduce volume/weight while maintaining structural integrity.</li>
								<li>Increase surface area as a means of maximizing heat transfer.</li>
								<li>Generate porosity in bone scaffolds and implants.</li>
								<li>Serve as a platform for structural optimization..</li>
							</ul>

							<p>IntralatticePro is a newly developed generative software and database for lattice and cellular structures. It is the professional version of original Intralattice, and aims to provide more help for designers to take advantages of lattice structures for different types of functional performance. By incorporating several design and simulation tools and advanced geometric modeling algorithms, IntralatticePro is more beneficial and robust on the design of lattice structures for different functional purposes, such as structural weight reduction, vibration control, energy absorption and heat dissipation.</p>

							<p>IntralatticeData is published on the website of IntralatticePro. It is a material database for lattice structures. It includes the lattice topologies in Intralattice. The effective elastic properties of lattice structures. As an Intralattice user, you can directly get the homogenized property of the lattice structure you are designing. Based on the information you get, you can modify the design to fulfill the functional requirement.</p>

							<p>SimuLattice is a MATLAB based software to support the simulaion-based design of lattice structure. Previous simulation models for lattice structure is either computational heavy or lack of accuracy. The proposed simulation scheme in SimuLattice has three simulation models that can be used in three design stages. It can help designers quickly and accurately get the mechanical property of lattice structures fabricated by additive manufacturing.</p>

							<p>The design of lattice structures can be divided into three design stages. In each stage, a simulation model is proposed. Furthermore, a material model is established in SimuLattice to consider the manufacturing influence of AM. There are totally four modules in SimuLattice:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Numerical homogenization models for initial design.</li>
								<li>Joint stiffening element model for design optimization.</li>
								<li>Hybrid element model for design validation.</li>
								<li>As-built material property model.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>ConsolidDesign is a plugin for Rhinoceros to support the identification and redesign of parts candidate for consolidation, which is specifically driven by the extremely expanded design freedoms of additive manufacturing. The design helps designers to semi-automatically identify part candidacy out of a complex product and guides them through the embodiment design step by step. </p>

							<p>The functionality offered by this tool include:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Interactive tool for establishing DSM-like part function interaction map.</li>
								<li>Automated identification of part candidates for consolidation.</li>
								<li>Guided steps for fusing the assembly into one single design space in preparation for structure optimization.</li>

							<p>With the rapid advancement of AM technologies, identifying parts which are eligible for AM as well as gaining insight on what value it may add to a product needs to be modelled in an objective and transferrable way. This tool aims at determining the candidacy of a part or assembly for AM based on its economic feasibility and potential for AM-specific benefits (such as lightweight, freeform shapes, and customization). This tool is also featured by its employment of machine learning algorithms with carefully sampled historical data. </p>

							<p>Some basic functionality included:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Several CAD format is supported (STEP, IGES, STL, CATPRODUCT, etc.)</li>
								<li>AM expertise is not required</li>
								<li>AM potentials are analyzed with regard to multiple criteria</li>
								<li>It also serves as a AM potential learning platform for beginners.</li>
